<body>
        <h1><i>The first of HTML Website</i></h1>
        <p>The html website is the first type of website in the world.
        We used this website for the first time in 1990.
        </p>
        <img src = "Tim.jpeg" alt = "Tim Berners-Lee" width = "400" height="275">
        <br>
        <small><em>Tim Berners-Lee is the creator of the HTML website.</em></small>
        </br>
        <p> As we know the first website is used for the military zone and education area.
        <br>
            With the popularity of the internet, the website is used for the business and other area,
            Such as the social media, online shopping, and so on.

        <small><em>Picture about happiness of using the internet</em></small>
        </br>
        <p>As we know, the internet is the most important thing in our life.
        <br>
